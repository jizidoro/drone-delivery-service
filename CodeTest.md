Drone Delivery Service:
A squad of drones is tasked with delivering packages for a major online reseller in a world where time and distance do not matter. Each drone can carry a specific weight and can make multiple deliveries before returning to home base to pick up additional loads. However, the goal is to make the fewest number of trips as each time the drone returns to home base, it is extremely costly to refuel and reload the drone.

Software Objective:
The purpose of the written software is to accept input which will include the name of each drone and the maximum weight it can carry, along with a series of locations and the total weight needed to be delivered to that specific location. The software should highlight the most efficient deliveries for each drone to make on each trip.

Input Format:

    Line 1: [Drone #1 Name], [#1 Maximum Weight], [Drone #2 Name], [#2 Maximum Weight], etc.
    Line 2: [Location #1 Name], [Location #1 Package Weight]
    Line 3: [Location #2 Name], [Location #2 Package Weight]
    ...and so forth.

Expected Output:
For each drone:

    [Drone #1 Name]
    Trip #1: [Location #2 Name], [Location #3 Name]
    Trip #2: [Location #1 Name]
    ...and so forth for other drones.

Solution Approach:

    Algorithm: Detailed and organized instructions about the solution implementation.
    Walk Through Solution: Two or three sentences that explain the solution approach and its implementation method.

Best Practices:
When developing the code solution, adhere to the following practices:

    Strive for legibility while keeping code concise.
    Cluster blocks of related code.
    Use indentation consistently for clarity, marking the start and end of control structures, methods, and functions.
    Ensure that the code is portable and can be executed in any environment without modifications.

Technical Dependencies and Libraries:
Detail any libraries or dependencies used in the project. Specify the versions of frameworks and applications used to write, compile, and run the code, such as Visual Code or Microsoft Visual Studio.
